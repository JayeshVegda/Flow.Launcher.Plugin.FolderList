# Folder List Plugin for Flow Launcher

A simple plugin that lets you quickly access your favorite folders using custom keywords.

## Features

- List files and folders from any directory
- Set custom keywords for your frequently used folders
- Quick access to your folders using keywords
- Easy navigation through folder contents

## How to Use

### Basic Usage

1. Open Flow Launcher
2. Type `folder` followed by:
   - A folder path (e.g., `folder C:/Your/Dog/Videos/Path`)
   - A keyword you've set (e.g., `folder dogvids`)

### Setting Up Keywords

1. Type a folder path (e.g., `folder C:/Your/Dog/Videos/Path`)
2. When you see the folder list, press the right arrow key (â†’) on any folder
3. Select "Set as Keyword" from the context menu
4. The folder will now be accessible using that keyword

### Managing Keywords

- Type `folder` without any additional text to see all your current keywords
- Click on any keyword to open its associated folder
- Keywords are automatically saved in `settings.json`

## Examples

```
folder C:/Videos/Dogs           # Browse the Dogs folder
folder dogvids                  # Access the folder using keyword
folder                         # List all your keywords
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the `folder_list_plugin.log` file for error messages
2. Make sure the paths you're trying to access exist
3. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the folders

## Settings

The plugin uses a `settings.json` file to store your keywords. You can edit this file directly if needed:

```json
{
    "keywords": {
        "dogvids": "C:/Videos/Dogs",
        "catvids": "C:/Videos/Cats"
    }
}
```
